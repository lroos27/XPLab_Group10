Experiment:

The experiment uses a within-subject design with one factor(conditions: "teammate", "opponent"). 
There are two bocks, one for each condition. 
Participants view 6 practice trials (3 per condition) and 36 main trials (18 per condition). 
Each of the trials consisted of one evidence map and a set of four treasure maps. The order of the blocks, the pairs of evidence and treasure maps and the four treasure maps themself were shuffled.
